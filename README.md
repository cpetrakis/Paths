# Paths

**Paths** is a web application that allows users to display and explore routes in **GPX** and **KML** formats. It provides detailed information about the routes such as description, distance, and elevation, and visualizes them on a map with multiple layers. The app is multilingual and built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

## Features

- **Display GPX and KML Routes**: Upload and visualize routes in GPX and KML formats.
- **Basic Route Details**: View descriptions, distance, and other route details.
- **Map with Multiple Layers**: Visualize routes on maps with support for different layers (e.g., satellite, terrain, street view).
- **Elevation Profile**: Show elevation data for the displayed route.
- **Multilingual Support**: Available in multiple languages for a wider user base.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
